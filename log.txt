    - Github is a pain in the ass to use I swear
    UPDATE: Github now works
    NEXT: Start on making a rough draft of what the game should look like

Log 2: 10 Oct 2022
    - Start n finish basic pygame screen
    UPDATE: Finished Collision test program in Collision test brach
    NEXT: Plan on how many pixel is one length unit

Log 3: 13 Oct 2022
    - Finish physic engine demo with pymunk
    - Entities should be in class which contains
        - whether the thing is static or dynamic
        - dimension of the entity
            - Must b able to change
        - 10 pixel = 1m
        init value:
            - mass
            - current position
            - current velocity
    Class for gravity n shit
        - So prob have to add different entities into the class
        - Must contain all the physic rules and update every entities
            it has
        - Can use function space.step(time_step) for update the sim
    UPDATE: Got gravity to work now. Not sure if having only 10x10 pixels
        is enough to make a well defined character. Maybe should just make the
        character like 2meters tall
    UPDATE: Simplifying the function even more. Now the entities creation and step
        update is in two functions

    - Starting on putting a test platform on map
    UPDATE: Got the platform to appear without falling. The object with Static = True
        will now stay in place.
    UPDATE: Fix the entity so that the x y coordinate is only contained in the pygame
        rect class, instead of having 2 different x y values for the pygame obj and
        the gravity calculation.
    - Worked on collision but rn the ghost still fall through the platform. The current
        fucntion check if the ghost and the plstform collides. If true, I set the ghost
        static value to True so the ghost will stay still. Rn it works cus I only have 1
        platform, but I gotta find way for it to work with multiple platforms and entities.
    High Log: 2:32am
        - Did simple character cntroll and now ghost can move.
    NEXT: IDk m high
    UPDATE: Seems like the colision rn have no problem with moving platformx
    UPDATE: The thing is very good. Enf High log for now.
