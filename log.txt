    - Github is a pain in the ass to use I swear
    UPDATE: Github now works
    NEXT: Start on making a rough draft of what the game should look like

Log 2: 10 Oct 2022
    - Start n finish basic pygame screen
    UPDATE: Finished Collision test program in Collision test brach
    NEXT: Plan on how many pixel is one length unit

Log 3: 13 Oct 2022
    - Finish physic engine demo with pymunk
    - Entities should be in class which contains
        - whether the thing is static or dynamic
        - dimension of the entity
            - Must b able to change
        - 10 pixel = 1m
        init value:
            - mass
            - current position
            - current velocity
    Class for gravity n shit
        - So prob have to add different entities into the class
        - Must contain all the physic rules and update every entities
            it has
        - Can use function space.step(time_step) for update the sim
    UPDATE: Got gravity to work now. Not sure if having only 10x10 pixels
        is enough to make a well defined character. Maybe should just make the
        character like 2meters tall
    UPDATE: Simplifying the function even more. Now the entities creation and step
        update is in two functions

    - Starting on putting a test platform on map
    UPDATE: Got the platform to appear without falling. The object with Static = True
        will now stay in place.
    UPDATE: Fix the entity so that the x y coordinate is only contained in the pygame
        rect class, instead of having 2 different x y values for the pygame obj and
        the gravity calculation.
    - Worked on collision but rn the ghost still fall through the platform. The current
        fucntion check if the ghost and the plstform collides. If true, I set the ghost
        static value to True so the ghost will stay still. Rn it works cus I only have 1
        platform, but I gotta find way for it to work with multiple platforms and entities.
    High Log: 2:32am
        - Did simple character cntroll and now ghost can move.
    NEXT: IDk m high
    UPDATE: Seems like the colision rn have no problem with moving platformx
    UPDATE: The thing is very good. Enf High log for now.

Log 5: 15 Oct 2022:
    - Add a small platform
    - Think for collision check I gotta make it loop over different static objects
    - Rn just make the player entity always the last one one list and the main
        platform is the first index
    UPDATE: Changed the shed attribute for Simulation so that it store entities based
        on whether they are static or dynamic. The collision now works by looping through
        dynamic entities and see if they collided with any static entities.
    NEXT: Work on streamlining the player controll and fix the jump

Log 6: 16 Oct 2022
    - The entity creation and the image load function required me to input dimension
        two times, maybe can find a better way to recieve the dimension [ACTION REQUIRED]
    UPDATE: Input fill collision into the game, still have a little bit of lag n bug but
        should be fine
    NEXT: Work on streamlining the player controll and fix the jump
        - For jump, the bot must detect if it is on ground
            - If it is, then it can jump by changing v velocity value

Log 7: 29 Oct 2022
    - Will try to fix the jump so that the player can only jump if on the platform
