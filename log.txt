    - Finish physic engine demo with pymunk
    - Entities should be in class which contains
        - whether the thing is static or dynamic
        - dimension of the entity
            - Must b able to change
        - 10 pixel = 1m
        init value:
            - mass
            - current position
            - current velocity
    Class for gravity n shit
        - So prob have to add different entities into the class
        - Must contain all the physic rules and update every entities
            it has
        - Can use function space.step(time_step) for update the sim
    UPDATE: Got gravity to work now. Not sure if having only 10x10 pixels
        is enough to make a well defined character. Maybe should just make the
